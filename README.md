# Dashboard for Renewable_Energy_Technical_Potential

In this project, I am going to visualize the data of renewable energy technical potential in the U.S. which includes following file:

* usretechnicalpotential.csv :

## Choropleth map of estimated technical potential for each kind of energy
(Note: By running the Jupyter file directly, we can display the choropleth map of estimated technical potential automatically. The image is the screen shot of the html.)

### 1. Utility-Scale Photovoltaics (Urban)

![alt tag](https://github.com/XintongHao/Analysis-of-Renewable_Energy_Technical_Potential/blob/master/choroplethMap/urbanUtilityScalePV.png)

Texas and California have the highest estimated technical potential, a result of a combination of good solar resource and large population

### 2. Utility-Scale Photovoltaics (Rural)

### 3. Rooftop Photovoltaics

States with the largest technical potential typically have the largest populations. California has the highest technical potential of 106 TWh due to its mix of high population and relatively good solar resource.

### 4. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP)

Technical potential for CSP exists predominately in the Southwest.

### 5. Onshore Wind Power

Technical potential for onshore wind power is largest in the central Great Plains and lowest in the southeastern United States.

### 6. Offshore Wind Power

Technical potential for offshore wind power is present in significant quantities in all offshore regions of the United States.

### 7.a. Biopower of Solid

### 9. Enhanced Geothermal Systems

![alt tag](https://github.com/XintongHao/Analysis-of-Renewable_Energy_Technical_Potential/blob/master/choroplethMap/EGSGeothermal.png)

The vast majority of the geothermal potential for EGS within the contiguous United States is located in the westernmost portion of the country.

### 10. Hydropower

Technical potential for hydropower exists predominately in the Northwest and Alaska.

## Conclusion
* Texas has the highest total estimated technical potential。
* The biggest proportion of estimated technical potential in most state is Utility-Scale Photovoltaics which relats to the solar resource and population.
* Technical potential for offshore wind power is present in significant quantities in all offshore regions of the United States such as Hawaii, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
* The vast majority of the geothermal potential for EGS within the contiguous United States is located in the westernmost portion of the country.
